## Original Package Description

This extension would post real time leads from magento to sugarcrm automatically. This extension also has the capability to transfer abandoned shopping carts from Magento to sugarcrm as opportunities which would allow your sales team to track the opportunity and convert to a sale. We also have a feature where once an opportunity is converted to a sale in sugarcrm, it can create an order in magento.
